# This is the base application.properties file that will be shared across all Environments.

# To override properties defined in this file with environment specific properties place the overrides
# in /src/main/resources/META-INF/configuration/<ENV>/config/application-override.properties
# The env overrides will be pulled in by the include statement above

# By default new applications created from Raptor 4.0.0, implements PPaaS specification v3.3.0.
# If this is removed, framework would fallback to Raptor 3.7.0's PPaaS behaviour.
ppaas.version=3.3.0
# Add your basic configuration below this point. Properties must come after the 
# include above for properties override to work correctly.
